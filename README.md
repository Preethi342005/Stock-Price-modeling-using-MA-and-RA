# Stock Price Modeling Using AR and MA Models

## 📌 Project Overview
Financial time series data such as stock prices exhibit strong temporal dependencies that cannot be effectively captured using simple trend-based analysis. This project focuses on modeling short-term stock price movements using **Autoregressive (AR)** and **Moving Average (MA)** models.

The objective is to understand the behavior of stock prices by leveraging historical values and past forecast errors, and to evaluate model performance using standard statistical diagnostics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze stock price time series data
- To understand and implement AR and MA models
- To select optimal lag values using ACF and PACF plots
- To evaluate model performance using AIC, BIC, and residual diagnostics
- To build a strong foundation for advanced forecasting models such as ARMA and ARIMA

## 🧠 Models Used
- **Autoregressive (AR) Model**
- **Moving Average (MA) Model**

Lag selection is performed using:
- Autocorrelation Function (ACF)
- Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)
